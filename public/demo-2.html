  <p>Try me out with Parcel or WebPack</p>

  <p>When using Parcel, we can easily point to this html file as the entry-point</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Parcel will build everything and put it in a `dist` folder</li>
    <li>We will need to change our script types from "module"</li>
    <li>We will need to "defer" or move where our script tags live on the page</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When using WebPack, you'll have to configure a lot more yourself.
    We can't point to this html file (without teaching WebPack how to handle htmls)
    and so instead we'll point to an entry javascript file, which loads all dependencies
    for a page.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The entry file should reference all dependencies.</li>
    <li>WebPack will bundle them for you and output a "built" file.</li>
    <li>We will need to update our html to point to the built file, or teach WebPack how to do that.</li>
  </ul>
